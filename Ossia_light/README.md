# 'LOSSIA': light ossia version, without primitives 

(not usable at the moment)

this light version is based on the old mgulibSC (https://github.com/pchdev/mgulibSC), only supporting standard OSC & Minuit protocol.

Just include the folder in SuperCollider's path, no custom build needed for this one.
