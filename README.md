# ossia-sc : libossia bindings for supercollider

## Installing (only macOS for now, linux should come pretty soon...)

### macOS

- clone this repository, cd into it
- run ./build.sh

SuperCollider folder with application should be now be installed in build/SuperCollider

the script clones a fresh version of supercollider (as of this day, version 3.8.0), adds and builds the libossia dependencies for sclang. Depending on your connection, the install process may take a little while, because of the complete download and build of the two applications.

for now, see: https://ossia.github.io/?javascript#introduction for early documentation of the ossia extension.
